## Introduction

Design patterns are reusable solutions to commonly occurring problems in software design. They provide a way to structure and organize code, making it more maintainable, scalable, and understandable. This repository demonstrates various design patterns implemented in Python, along with explanations and examples.

## Design Patterns

### 1. Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables an algorithm's behavior to be selected at runtime. It defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. This pattern allows the algorithm to vary independently of the clients that use it, promoting flexibility and extensibility.

[Example Code](./strategy_pattern)

## Usage

To run the examples, simply execute each Python file using a Python interpreter.

```bash
python ./strategy_pattern/main.py
