## Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations. It aims to solve the problem of telescoping constructor anti-pattern where the number of constructor parameters becomes excessive.

### Key Components:

1. **Builder**: Abstract interface or class that defines the steps to build the product object.

2. **Concrete Builders**: Concrete implementations of the builder interface, providing specific implementations for building the product.

3. **Director**: Controls the construction process using the builder interface to construct the final product.

4. **Product**: Represents the complex object being constructed.

### How It Works:

- The client interacts with the director to initiate the construction process.
- The director delegates construction steps to the builder, which knows how to create the parts of the product.
- The builder constructs the product step by step, and when finished, returns the product to the client.
- The client can then retrieve the final product from the builder.

### Benefits:

- **Separation of Concerns**: Separates the construction process from the representation, allowing for more flexibility and reuse.
- **Simplifies Object Construction**: Makes object construction more readable and maintainable, especially for complex objects with many parameters.
- **Facilitates Variation**: Allows different representations of the same object to be constructed using the same construction process.

### Usage:

- Use the Builder Pattern when the construction of a complex object involves multiple steps or variations.
- It is useful when you need to construct objects with many optional parameters or configurations.
- Apply this pattern when you want to separate the construction logic from the final object representation.

### Example Scenario:

Consider a pizza restaurant where customers can customize their pizza orders with various toppings, crust types, and sizes. The Builder Pattern can be used to construct custom pizza objects with different combinations of toppings, crusts, and sizes. The director (pizza chef) controls the construction process, while the concrete builders (topping builder, crust builder, size builder) provide specific implementations for building the pizza.
