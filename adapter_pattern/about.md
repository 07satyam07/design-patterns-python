# Adapter Pattern

The Adapter Pattern is a structural design pattern that allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by providing a wrapper or intermediary class that translates the interface of one class into another interface that a client expects.

## Problem

In software development, it's common to encounter situations where existing classes or components have interfaces that are incompatible with the rest of the system. Integrating such components directly into the system would require significant changes to the existing codebase, which may not be feasible or desirable.

## Solution

The Adapter Pattern solves this problem by introducing an adapter class that implements the interface expected by the client and delegates the calls to the incompatible interface to the wrapped object. This allows the client to interact with the incompatible object as if it were compatible with the rest of the system.

## Structure

- **Target**: Defines the interface that the client uses.
- **Adapter**: Implements the target interface and wraps the object that has the incompatible interface.
- **Adaptee**: Defines the existing interface that needs to be adapted.
- **Client**: Collaborates with objects through the target interface.
