## Facade Pattern

The Facade Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a complex system of classes, libraries, or subsystems. It encapsulates a set of interfaces in a higher-level interface, making it easier to use and understand.

### Key Components:

1. **Facade**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It delegates client requests to appropriate objects within the subsystem.

2. **Subsystem Classes**: Classes that implement the functionality of the subsystem. These classes are hidden from the client by the facade.

### How It Works:

- The client interacts with the facade, which provides a simplified interface to the subsystem.
- The facade delegates client requests to the appropriate objects within the subsystem, coordinating their actions as needed.
- The client is shielded from the complexity of the subsystem, as it interacts only with the facade.

### Benefits:

- **Simplified Interface**: Provides a simple and unified interface to a complex subsystem, making it easier to use.
- **Decoupling**: Decouples the client from the implementation details of the subsystem, promoting loose coupling.
- **Encapsulation**: Encapsulates the complexity of the subsystem behind a facade, hiding its implementation details.

### Usage:

- Use the Facade Pattern when you need to provide a simple interface to a complex subsystem.
- It is useful when you want to decouple client code from the implementation details of the subsystem.
- Apply this pattern when you want to promote encapsulation and reduce the complexity of client code.

### Example Scenario:

Consider a multimedia player application that can play various types of media files, such as audio, video, and images. The multimedia player subsystem consists of multiple classes responsible for handling different types of media files, decoding them, and displaying them on the screen. Instead of exposing the details of each media player class to the client, a facade can be used to provide a unified interface for playing media files. The facade abstracts the complexity of the multimedia player subsystem and provides simple methods like `play_audio()`, `play_video()`, and `display_image()` for the client to interact with.
