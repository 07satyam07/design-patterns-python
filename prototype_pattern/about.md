## Prototype Pattern

The Prototype Pattern is a creational design pattern that allows you to create new objects by cloning existing ones, without knowing their specific classes. It is useful when the construction of an object is costly or complex, and you want to avoid repeatedly creating new instances using constructors.

### Key Components:

1. **Prototype Interface**: Defines the interface for cloning itself.

2. **Concrete Prototypes**: Classes that implement the prototype interface and provide the cloning behavior.

3. **Client**: Initiates the cloning process by requesting a new object from the prototype.

### How It Works:

- The prototype interface typically includes a method for cloning the object.
- Concrete prototypes implement the cloning method by creating a new instance of themselves and copying their internal state to the new object.
- The client requests new objects from the prototype by calling the cloning method on a prototype instance.

### Benefits:

- **Reduced Cost of Object Creation**: Avoids the overhead of repeatedly creating new objects using constructors, especially for complex or costly construction processes.
- **Flexibility**: Allows for the creation of new objects at runtime based on existing prototypes, enabling dynamic object creation.
- **Encapsulation of Construction Logic**: Encapsulates the object creation logic within the prototype, promoting encapsulation and separation of concerns.

### Usage:

- Use the Prototype Pattern when the cost of creating an object using constructors is high or the construction process is complex.
- It is useful when you need to create multiple instances of similar objects with varying states.
- Apply this pattern when you want to decouple the client from the specific classes of objects being created.

### Example Scenario:

Consider a game where you have different types of enemies with varying attributes such as health, speed, and damage. Instead of creating each enemy type from scratch using constructors, you can use the Prototype Pattern. Each enemy type (e.g., Goblin, Orc) serves as a prototype, and you can clone these prototypes to create new enemy instances with specific attributes at runtime.
