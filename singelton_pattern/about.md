## Singleton Pattern

The Singleton Pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is commonly used when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

### Key Components:

1. **Singleton Class**:
   - Defines a class with a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation.
   - Provides a static method to access the singleton instance, ensuring that only one instance is created and allowing global access to it.

### How It Works:

- The Singleton Pattern ensures that a class has only one instance by providing a mechanism to control its instantiation process.
- It typically involves defining a class with a private constructor to prevent external instantiation and a static method to provide access to the singleton instance.
- The first time the static method is called, it creates the singleton instance and returns it. Subsequent calls to the static method return the same instance.

### Benefits:

- **Guarantees Single Instance**: Ensures that only one instance of the class is created and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Lazy Initialization**: The singleton instance is created only when needed, improving memory usage and startup time.
- **Global Access**: Allows objects to access the singleton instance from anywhere in the codebase.

### Usage:

- Use the Singleton Pattern when you need exactly one instance of a class throughout the application's lifecycle.
- It is useful in scenarios where a single point of control or coordination is required, such as managing configuration settings, logging, database connections, or thread pools.

### Example Scenario:

In a logging system, you may want to ensure that there is only one logger instance throughout the application to centralize logging functionality. The Singleton Pattern can be used to create a Logger class with a single instance that can be accessed globally by other parts of the application.
